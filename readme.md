## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- jsdeliver

### What I learned

First of all I've finally "mastered" CSS-Grid and it's awesome. Without any tutorial and just with the documentation I've handled the position of the elements in the grid. With my knowledge about the positioning-attributes from the last challenges I've created a nice "portfolio-grid".

JS is further my final boss. It cost me a lot of time to implement the slider and I'm definetly not happy about it. The slider works well but I missed to create the requested controll buttons.
